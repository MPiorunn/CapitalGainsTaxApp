- Create a gradle module with common stuff like URI utils etc.
- Dockerize services
- Add databases for each service that'll store data (dockerize them as well)
- Add kubernetes to for loadbalancing, service discovery
- Add integration tests between modules?
- Increase code coverage, controller tests are missing :(
